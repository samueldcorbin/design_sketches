## Healing Prototype

A mockup for an MMO-style healing system (healing that targets player health and negative status effects) that makes the support role accessible to more casual players with slower and less complex decision-making, but also supports significant optional depth and complexity of moment-to-moment decisions. Players are able to dynamically decide how much depth to take on from moment to moment rather than deciding categorically beforehand. A "full" healer is possible, but it is also be possible for a healer to mix in offense while healing, and these two options can be tuned such that the difference in DPS contribution to a party is not too dissimilar. Total throughput always incentivizes grouping (dividing a large group into smaller formal groups is never advantageous). Implementation is easy to tune and extensible - easy to add more status effects and more healing abilities that target categories of status effects.
